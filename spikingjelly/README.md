SpikingJelly is an open-source deep learning framework for Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

The documentation of SpikingJelly is written in both English and Chinese: https://spikingjelly.readthedocs.io

## Installation

Note that SpikingJelly is based on PyTorch. Please make sure that you have installed PyTorch before you install SpikingJelly.

Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/spikingjelly/)：

```bash
pip install spikingjelly
```

Developers can download and install the latest version from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fangwei123456/spikingjelly.git
cd spikingjelly
python setup.py install
```

## Build SNN In An Unprecedented Simple Way

SpikingJelly is user-friendly. Building SNN with SpikingJelly is as simple as building ANN in PyTorch:

```python
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, tau=100.0, v_threshold=1.0, v_reset=0.0):
        super().__init__()
        # Network structure, a simple two-layer fully connected network, each layer is followed by LIF neurons
        self.fc = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Flatten(),
            nn.Linear(28 * 28, 14 * 14, bias=False),
            neuron.LIFNode(tau=tau, v_threshold=v_threshold, v_reset=v_reset),
            nn.Linear(14 * 14, 10, bias=False),
            neuron.LIFNode(tau=tau, v_threshold=v_threshold, v_reset=v_reset)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)
```

This simple network with a Poisson encoder can achieve 92% accuracy on MNIST test dataset. Read [the tutorial of clock driven](https://spikingjelly.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/tutorial_en.clock_driven.html) for more details. You can also run this code in Python terminal for training on classifying MNIST:

```python
>>> import spikingjelly.clock_driven.examples.lif_fc_mnist as lif_fc_mnist
>>> lif_fc_mnist.main()
```

Read [spikingjelly.clock_driven.examples](https://spikingjelly.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/spikingjelly.clock_driven.examples.html) to explore more advanced networks!

## Device Supports

-   [x] Nvidia GPU
-   [x] CPU

As simple as using PyTorch.

```python
>>> net = nn.Sequential(nn.Flatten(), neuron.LIFNode(tau=tau))
>>> net = net.to(device) # Can be CPU or CUDA devices
```
